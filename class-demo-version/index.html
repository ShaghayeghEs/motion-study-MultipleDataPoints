          Project Title: Perception of Motion in Graph
          </br>
          Principal Investigator: Eric Ragan, PhD
          </br>
          </br>
          Introduction</b>
          </br>
          You are invited to take part in a research study being conducted by a research team from Texas
          A&M University. The information in this form is provided to help you decide whether or not to
          take part. If you decide you do not want to participate, there will be no penalty to you, and you
          will not lose any benefits you normally would have.
          </br>
          </br>
          <b>Why Is This Study Being Done?</b>
          </br>
          The purpose of this study is to test the perception of users of encoded motion into graphs.
          </br>
          </br>
          <b>Why Am I Being Asked To Be In This Study?</b>
          </br>
           Participants are needed to help us better understand if motion can be incorporated to encode
           numerical values into a graph. Participants' interaction with the system will help us to
           incorporate motion into graphs more accurately. You are being asked to be in this study because you expressed interest in participation.
          </br>
          </br>
          <b>How Many People Will Be Asked To Be In This Study?</b>
          </br>
           Up to 100 people may be contacted about participating.
          </br>
          </br>
          <b>What Are the Alternatives to being in this study?</b>
          </br>
          The alternative to being in the study is not to participate.
          </br>
          </br>
          <b>What Will I Be Asked To Do In This Study?</b>
          </br>
          Each participant will be given a set of graphs. In each graph, data will be encoded by different
          types of motion. The participant will be asked to quantify the difference between motions with
          numerical values. Participant will need to answer simple questions i.e. "how much faster is one
          moving object than another?" by entering different numerical values i.e.1,2,3 etc. </br>          </br>
          <b>Are There Any Risks To Me?</b>
          </br>
          Risks are minimal because the study involves looking at moving shapes on a computer screen.
          As the participants will repeatedly view moving graphics, minimal risk of eye strain or motion
          sickness can occur. However, this is not expected, and participants can choose to leave the study
          any time if they do not feel comfortable. The participants may pause the study for a period of
          time and resume it if they are willing to do so. Collected data will be destroyed when the
          research project is concluded. The recorded results of your use with the software during the
          analysis activity will be saved and made publicly available online, but this data will not include
          any of your personal information. No photos, audio recordings, or video recordings of you will
          be collected or shared.
          </br>
          </br>
          <b>Will There Be Any Costs To Me?</b></br>
          Aside from your time; there are no costs for taking part in the study.
          </br>
          </br>
          <b>Will I Be Paid To Be In This Study?</b>
          Participation is voluntary and no compensation will be given.
          </br></br>
          <b>Who will know about my participation in this research study?</b></br>
          Information about you will be kept confidential and not shared with others. Only the approved
          members of the research team will have access to the information collected during your
          participation. In addition, representatives of regulatory agencies such as the Office of Human
          Research Protections (OHRP) and entities such as the Texas A&M University Human Subjects
          Protection Program may access your records to make sure the study is being run correctly and
          that information is collected and secured properly.
